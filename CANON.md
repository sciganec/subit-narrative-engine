## 📝 Notes on Usage

1. **Archetypes are not characters** — they are states a character can occupy
2. **Characters can transmute** — moving between archetypes is the essence of plot
3. **Multiple archetypes** — complex characters may embody different archetypes in different contexts
4. **Cultural variation** — names and interpretations may vary across cultures; the binary code remains invariant
