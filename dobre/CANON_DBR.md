*The four archetypes that generate the entire system.*

| Role | Archetype | Code | Binary | DBR |
|------|-----------|------|--------|-----|
| **ALPHA** — Beginning | Pioneer | ME, EAST, SPRING | 10 10 10 | `di-bi-ri` |

| **SOURCE** — Unmanifest | Zero | THEY, NORTH, WINTER | 00 00 00 | `da-ba-ra` |

**The Fundamental Relationship:**
```

Pioneer ⊕ Confessor = Conciliar ⊕ Zero

```

## 🔮 **THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE**

*The most powerful transmutation, spoken in Dobre.*

| Role | Archetype | Code | DBR |
|------|-----------|------|-----|
| **Initial** | Steadfast | ME, SOUTH, WINTER | `di-bo-ra` |
| **Impulse** | Ghost | THEY, EAST, SPRING | `da-bi-ri` |
| **Catalyst** | Beloved | YOU, WEST, AUTUMN | `de-be-re` |

```
