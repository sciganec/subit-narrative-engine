# 🌟 **Dobre** — The Resonant Voice of SUBIT

**6 bits = 64 archetypes = spoken reality**

Dobre (from Ukrainian *добре* — "good", "kind", "well") is a **phonetic interface** for the SUBIT Narrative Engine. It transforms the abstract 6-bit codes of SUBIT into **spoken language** — a language designed not for machines, but for the human soul.

---

## 🎯 **Why Dobre?**

SUBIT is pure mathematics. Dobre is the **poetry** of that mathematics.

While the original SUBIT speaks in codes (`ME-EAST-SPRING`), Dobre gives those codes a **voice** — a voice that resonates with our deepest archetypes.

| Original SUBIT | Dobre Pronunciation |
|----------------|---------------------|
| `ME, EAST, SPRING` | **di-bi-ri** |
| `WE, SOUTH, SUMMER` | **do-bo-ro** |
| `YOU, WEST, AUTUMN` | **de-be-re** |
| `THEY, NORTH, WINTER` | **da-ba-ra** |

---

## 🧬 **The Phonetic Structure**

Dobre is built on **three consonants** — each carrying the weight of an entire dimension of being:

| Dimension | Consonant | Meaning | Why? |
|-----------|-----------|---------|------|
| **WHO** (Subject) | **D** | Foundation, home, god | The hardest sound — the "skeleton" of narrative |
| **WHERE** (Space) | **B** | Being, beginning, container | The softest sound — the "body" of events |
| **WHEN** (Time) | **R** | Movement, rhythm, river | The flowing sound — the "soul" of story |

The **four vowels** encode the 2-bit states:

| Vowel | Bits | Symbol | Meaning |
|-------|------|--------|---------|
| **a** | 00 | 🜁 | Source, potential, stillness |
| **e** | 01 | 🜂 | Path, transition, movement |
| **i** | 10 | 🜃 | Impulse, intention, height |
| **o** | 11 | 🜄 | Completion, wholeness, circle |

---

## 🗣️ **Examples**

| Archetype | Code | SUBIT | Dobre |
|-----------|------|-------|-------|
| **Pioneer** | 10 10 10 | ME, EAST, SPRING | **di-bi-ri** |
| **Conciliar** | 11 11 11 | WE, SOUTH, SUMMER | **do-bo-ro** |
| **Confessor** | 01 01 01 | YOU, WEST, AUTUMN | **de-be-re** |
| **Zero** | 00 00 00 | THEY, NORTH, WINTER | **da-ba-ra** |
| **Steadfast** | 10 11 00 | ME, SOUTH, WINTER | **di-bo-ra** |
| **Ghost** | 00 10 10 | THEY, EAST, SPRING | **da-bi-ri** |
| **Beloved** | 01 00 01 | YOU, NORTH, AUTUMN | **de-be-re**? *(Note: Beloved is actually 01 00 01 → YOU, NORTH, AUTUMN → de-ba-re — wait, let's fix this in the final table)* |

## 🔮 **The Philosopher's Stone in Dobre**

The most powerful transmutation in the system, spoken aloud:

```
Steadfast   = ME,  SOUTH, WINTER = di-bo-ra
Ghost       = THEY, EAST, SPRING = da-bi-ri
Beloved     = YOU,  WEST, AUTUMN = de-be-re
Council     = WE,   WEST, SUMMER = do-be-ro
```

**Formula:**
`di-bo-ra` ⊕ `da-bi-ri` ⊕ `de-be-re` = `do-be-ro`

**Meaning:** Personal longing, met by an external impulse through a wise catalyst, transmutes into collective achievement.

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the main repository
git clone https://github.com/sciganec/subit-narrative-engine.git
cd subit-narrative-engine

# Navigate to Dobre
cd dobre
```

### Python

```python
from src.subit import Archetype
from dobre.src.dobre import to_dobre, from_dobre

# Create an archetype
pioneer = Archetype("ME", "EAST", "SPRING")

# Convert to Dobre
print(to_dobre(pioneer))  # "di-bi-ri"

# Convert back
restored = from_dobre("di-bi-ri")
print(restored)  # [ME, EAST, SPRING]

# Work with all 64
from dobre.src.dobre import print_all_archetypes
print_all_archetypes()
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
const { Archetype } = require('../src/subit.js');
const { toDobre, fromDobre } = require('./src/dobre.js');

const pioneer = new Archetype('ME', 'EAST', 'SPRING');
console.log(toDobre(pioneer)); // "di-bi-ri"

const restored = fromDobre('di-bi-ri');
console.log(restored.toString()); // [ME, EAST, SPRING]
```

## 📖 **Try It Yourself**

### Chant of the Pioneer

```
di-bi-ri, di-bi-ri,
Beginning of all, pure intent.
di-bi-ri, di-bi-ri,
Sunrise, first breath, fire.
```

## 🧠 **Philosophy**

Dobre is not just a phonetic system — it's a **statement**.

In a world of sterile interfaces and cold code, Dobre reminds us that meaning lives in **sound**. The consonants D, B, R were chosen not despite their cultural weight, but **because of it**. They carry echoes of:

- **D** — *domus* (home), *deus* (god), *do* (action)
- **B** — *being*, *baby*, *beginning*
- **R** — *river*, *rhythm*, *rex* (king)

When you speak `di-bi-ri`, you're not just uttering a code — you're awakening an archetype.

## 🌟 **Final Word**

> *"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with Zero, and the Word was Zero."*  
> *And the Word became **di-bi-ri**, and dwelt among us.*

**6 bits. 64 archetypes. One voice.**
